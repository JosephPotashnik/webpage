                <li>
                    <strong>Researcher, Computational Linguistics Laboratory, Tel Aviv University, Israel (2015-2016)</strong>
                    <p>Topic: Unsupervised Grammar Induction.</p>
                    <p>Research of a computational model for the linguistic phenomenon of unbounded movement. Discovered that a class of mildly context-sensitive grammars (Linear Indexed Grammars) provides a natural choice from a generativist viewpoint. Developed an innovative stochastic Earley Parser for Linear Indexed Grammars. Researched the learnability of the model within a Minimal Description Length (MDL) framework (projects found under: <a href="https://github.com/JosephPotashnik/LIG" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). The learner employs Simulated Annealing to traverse hypothesis space.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ph.D, Tel Aviv University, Israel (2010-2015)</strong>
                    <p>Developed a theory on how causal and scalar components of predicates and arguments dictate their syntactic realizations, exploring the interface between lexical semantics and syntactic structure. Dissertation available on GitHub. Secured the prestigious Rotenstreich Scholarship for outstanding Ph.D. students for a 3-year period (granted to 20 students nationwide by the Council for Higher Education).</p>
