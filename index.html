        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Joseph. I'm a software Engineer and a researcher in natural language processing and learning.</p>
        <p>I was a back-end developer at a start-up company and wrote mostly in C#. The position included ownership of various projects across all architectural layers of the software and hardware.</p>
        <p>In recent years I've dedicated myself to an experimental, cutting-edge machine learning project involving Grammar Induction, which is the inference of a grammar (language model) from input text alone. This is an example of <em> unsupervised learning </em>. You can learn more about it in my <a href="#projects">projects</a> below.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I'm an avid bookworm, a black coffee aficionado and a serial petter of all pets. Scuba diving is one of the apexes (or 'apices' if you're a stickler for Latin) of creation. </p>
        <p>I'm hearing impaired and wearing two cochlear implants, feel free to ask me more about it. </p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p> One of my main interests is unsupervised learning, a branch of machine learning. It is useful to approach unsupervised learning by contrasting it with its more commonly used sibling, supervised learning. 
            In the latter case, the data is <em>labeled</em> or <em>tagged</em> with the values of the target variable,
            which we have correctly chosen in advance (we then say that the learning is supervised by the target variable). It means that a designer of a supervised learning algorithm had already studied the data 
            and deduced what we would like to predict. The designer had looked at the data and <em>learned</em> the target variable &mdash; not the algorithm. But how was it done? How did they know what to look for?</p>
        
         <div class="center">
            <img id="img1" src="supervised-learning-data_vs_unsupervised-learning-data-small.png" alt="An image that compares training datasets for supervised learning vs unsupervised learning.  The supervised learning dataset has a &quot;target&quot; variable, while the 
            unsupervised learning data does not.">
        
         <a id="link1" href="https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning/" target="_blank"> image source </a>
        </div>   

        <p> In the real world, data  does not magically arrive labeled with what we're looking for. The task of what we would like to predict falls to us: 
            we must seek patterns and relationships within the data to uncover the target variable ourselves. Learning our native language, clustering, 
            and dimensionality reduction are all examples of unsupervised learning tasks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Clustering</h2>
            <p> Clustering is a classical example of the field. There has been quite a lot of research into clustering algorithms. My own favourite type is <em> density-based</em> algorithms like DBSCAN or Density Peaks.
                I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/JosephPotashnik/DensityPeaksClustering" target="_blank">C# library</a> that implements various Density Peaks based clustering algorithms, 
                a <a href="https://github.com/JosephPotashnik/DensityPeaksClusteringService" target="_blank"> .NET Core WebAPI service </a> which wraps the previous library, 
                and a <a href="https://github.com/JosephPotashnik/DensityPeaks"> slim frontend</a> in javascript that allows the user to interact with the algorithms and observe results. 
            </p>

        <h2>Grammar Induction (parser available)</h2>
            <p> I am in the process of developing a cutting-edge Grammar Induction algorithm. This is (a part of) the task faced by a child learning their native language. 
                The paper, which can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15321" target="_blank">here</a>, 
                is still to be published, hence the sofware is not yet ready to be made public. Nonetheless, the learner uses a highly optimised 
                <a href="https://github.com/JosephPotashnik/EarleyParser" target="_blank">Earley Parser</a> which is available. 
                I am in the process of making it a service.
